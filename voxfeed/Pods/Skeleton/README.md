An easy way to create sliding `CAGradientLayer` animations! Works great for creating skeleton screens for loading content.

I plan on expanding this library with functionality that allows easily converting a regular `UITableViewCell` or `UICollectionViewCell` to it's skeleton screen equivalent, hence the name Skeleton. I just haven't figured out exactly how I want to do that yet! :sweat_smile:

----------------

## Overview

In essence, the entire library comes down to just one extension:

```swift
public extension CAGradientLayer {
  public func slide(to dir: Direction, group: ((CAAnimationGroup) -> CAAnimationGroup) = { $0 })
  public func stopSliding()
}
```
Everything else is there to help you out and provide convenience! You can check out the [documentation](http://www.gonzalonunez.me/Skeleton/) for more.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

Skeleton is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
